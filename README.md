# game-of-greed
**Author**: Raven W. Robertson
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
I'll be creating a dice game to play in my command line. For class01 I'll be implementing the following features:
Application should simulate rolling between 1 and 6 dice, allow user to set aside dice each roll, should ask user to enter score per roll, allow “banking” current score or rolling again.
Application should keep track of total score and it should keep track of current round.

## Getting Started
I'll be writing this code in python in a pipenv. 

## Architecture
I built this application using python3

## API
I'm not using an API for this application. 

## Change Log
10:00pm - features all working but a little buggy. Can't get dict to hold onto infor for longer that one roll of dice? Check with JB ot James tomorrow  7/8/19
11:44pm - worked out most bugs. Trying to build a tally score function to over write user input for score. I built a test for the function. I'm able to get the user input into the function and stored in a dictionary, but the actual tally isn't working and I just need to sleep.
