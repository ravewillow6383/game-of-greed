# game-of-greed
**Author**: Raven W. Robertson
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
I'll be creating a dice game to play in my command line. For class01 I'll be implementing the following features:
Application should simulate rolling between 1 and 6 dice, allow user to set aside dice each roll, should ask user to enter score per roll, allow “banking” current score or rolling again.
Application should keep track of total score and it should keep track of current round.

## Getting Started
I'll be writing this code in python in a pipenv. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->

## API
I'm not using an API for this application.
